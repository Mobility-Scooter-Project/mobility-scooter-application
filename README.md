## Introduction
[In today's aging global population, mobility scooters are not just a convenience but a necessity for maintaining the independence and quality of life of the elderly and those with mobility challenges. Although insurance often covers these mobility aids, their usage rate remains surprisingly low. One of the primary reasons for this underutilization is the fear and apprehension users have when it comes to operating these vehicles, primarily due to safety concerns.]

## Purpose
[The core objective of this project is to bridge the existing safety assessment gap for mobility scooter users. Mobility scooters, indispensable for maintaining a good quality of life, come with their own set of risks. These risks are multi-faceted, arising from the users' driving skills, the environment in which these scooters are operated, and the specific safety features of different scooter models. This project aims to offer a comprehensive evaluation system that assesses all these factors, thereby alleviating safety concerns and encouraging more widespread use of mobility scooters.]
